# COCOMO II Analysis
COCOMO II (Constructive Cost Model II) is a software cost estimation model that uses Function Points (FP) or Source Lines of Code (SLOC) to estimate effort, schedule, and cost. 

Based on the 487 Function Points computed durint the [Function Points Analysis](https://github.com/GreyJolly/1982874_4-by-4/blob/main/booklets/Function%20Points%20Analysis.md), we will perform a COCOMO II analysis to estimate the effort required for the 4-by-4 platform.

## Convert Function Points to SLOC

COCOMO II typically uses Source Lines of Code (SLOC) for estimation. For a mixed-language project (JS, HTML, CSS, PHP), we can use the following average SLOC per FP values:

JavaScript: 53 SLOC/FP

HTML/CSS: 40 SLOC/FP

PHP: 50 SLOC/FP

Assuming the project is evenly distributed across these languages, the average SLOC/FP is approximately 48 SLOC/FP.

Total SLOC: 487 FP × 48 SLOC/FP = 23,376 SLOC.

## COCOMO II Parameters

COCOMO II uses the following formula to estimate effort:

$$\text{Effort}=A\times \text{SLOC}\cdot E \times \prod_{i=1}^nEM_i$$

Where:

$A$ = 2.94 (for COCOMO II)

$E$ = Exponent (depends on project scale factors)

$EM_i$​ = Effort Multipliers (based on cost drivers)

### Scale Factors (SF)

Scale factors account for project complexity. For this project, we assume the following values:

Scale|Factor|Rating|Value
---|---|---|---
Precedentedness|(PREC)	Low|(new|project)	4.96
Development|Flexibility|(FLEX)	High|(flexible|requirements)	2.03
Architecture/Risk|Resolution|(RESL)	High|(good|risk|management)	2.83
Team|Cohesion|(TEAM)	High|(experienced|team)	2.19
Process|Maturity|(PMAT)	High|(well-defined|process)|3.12

Total Scale Factor (SF): Sum of all scale factors = 15.13

Exponent (E): $E=0.91+0.01×SF=0.91+0.01×15.13=1.0613E=0.91+0.01×SF=0.91+0.01×15.13=1.0613$

### Effort Multipliers (EM)

Effort multipliers adjust the effort based on cost drivers. For this project, we assume the following values:

Cost Driver|Rating|Value
---|---|---
Required Software Reliability (RELY)|High (reliable system)|1.10
Database Size (DATA)|Nominal (moderate database size)|1.00
Product Complexity (CPLX)|High (moderate complexity)|1.17
Required Reusability (RUSE)|Nominal (some reuse)|1.00
Documentation Match to Lifecycle Needs (DOCU)|High (good documentation)|1.11
Execution Time Constraint (TIME)|Nominal (no strict constraints)|1.00
Storage Constraint (STOR)|Nominal (no strict constraints)|1.00
Platform Volatility (PVOL)|Low (stable platform)|0.87
Analyst Capability (ACAP)|High (experienced analysts)|0.85
Programmer Capability (PCAP)|High (experienced developers)|0.88
Personnel Continuity (PCON)|High (low turnover)|0.81
Application Experience (APEX)|High (experienced team)|0.88
Platform Experience (PLEX)|High (experienced with platform)|0.85
Language and Tool Experience (LTEX)|High (experienced with tools)|0.88
Use of Software Tools (TOOL)|High (good tool support)|0.90
Multisite Development (SITE)|Nominal (single site)|1.00
Required Development Schedule (SCED)|Nominal (no schedule compression)|1.00

Total Effort Multiplier (EM): Product of all EM values = 0.38

### Effort Estimation

Using the COCOMO II formula:

$$\text{Effort}=2.94×\text{SLOC}^{1.0613}×EM$$

$$\text{Effort}=2.94×23376^{1.0613}×0.38$$

$$\text{Effort}=2.94×34,567×0.38≈38,500 \text{person-hours}$$

Effort in Person-Months: Assuming 152 working hours per month (8 hours/day × 19 days/month), the effort is:

$$\text{Effort}=\frac{38500}{152}≈253 \text{person-months}$$
